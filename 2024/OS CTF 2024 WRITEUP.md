![The statue is being repaired-02](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whyuhurtz/hackmd-blog/main/2024/_assets/os-ctf_osint1-02.png)

- The image looks same, and then I explore the tag in the post `#FPTAround`.
- Seems like it refers to the **FPT University in Vietnam**.

![The statue is being repaired-03](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whyuhurtz/hackmd-blog/main/2024/_assets/os-ctf_osint1-03.png)

- I do more exploration about **fptaround** and luckily I got the community page in Facebook: [_https://www.facebook.com/fptaround_](https://www.facebook.com/fptaround).

![The statue is being repaired-05](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whyuhurtz/hackmd-blog/main/2024/_assets/os-ctf_osint1-05.png)

- Nice, we got the city name: **Ho Chi Minh**.
- Next, we've to found what is the statue name. I just search FPT university statue in google, and found the useful wiki link: [_https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Self-made_Man_statue_at_FPT_University_Ha_Noi.jpg_](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Self-made_Man_statue_at_FPT_University_Ha_Noi.jpg).

```javascript

	const flagInput = document.getElementById('flagInput').value;
	const result = document.getElementById('result');
	const flag = "OSCTF{Cr4zY_In5P3c71On}";

pfft .. Listen, I've gained access to this login portal but I'm not
able to log in. The admins are surely hiding something from
the public, but ... I don't understand what. Here take the link
and be quiet, don't share it with anyone

### Solve Walkthrough

- From the title we know that the challenge is the web app vulnerable to **SQL injection attack**.
- Just performing basic SQL injection payload to bypass login: `1' OR 1=1--`.
- Use the payload in username and password and it will make the username and password val0id. 4. In the default page, it will show the **fake flag**. You must be careful okay.

![Heads or Tails-01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whyuhurtz/hackmd-blog/main/2024/_assets/os-ctf_web2-01.png)

- But, you can access the admin page directly by changing the endpoint to `/admin` (if you know).

![Heads or Tails-02](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whyuhurtz/hackmd-blog/main/2024/_assets/os-ctf_web2-02.png)

- If you don't know what all endpoints or subdirectories inside the web page, you can do **directory scanning** using tool like **dirsearch**, **feroxbuster**, **dirb**, or **gobuster**. I recommend to use **dirsearch** cause they have default wordlist.

### Solve Walkthrough

- Given a web app that we can see personal information, but notice that every person is have unique id: `?user_id` value parameters.

![Indoor WebApp-01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whyuhurtz/hackmd-blog/main/2024/_assets/os-ctf_web3-01.png)

- I try to change it to person **2** or `?user_id=2` and I got the flag.

![Indoor WebApp-02](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whyuhurtz/hackmd-blog/main/2024/_assets/os-ctf_web3-02.png)

- We can perform brute force attack to check if the spesific `user_id` is exist or not by using **Burp Suite** or simply **cURL** (combined with for/while loop).

![Indoor WebApp-03](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whyuhurtz/hackmd-blog/main/2024/_assets/os-ctf_web3-03.png)

- Luckily, we just have 3 available users.

![Action Notes-01](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/whyuhurtz/hackmd-blog/main/2024/_assets/os-ctf_web4-01.png)

- Try to guess common user passwords, such as:

| Username | Password  |

| admin    | password  |
| admin    | admin123  |
